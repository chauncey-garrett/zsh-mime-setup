Designed for Prezto...compatible with Oh My Zsh.

Inits [zsh-mime-setup](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/zsh/zsh-48/zsh/Functions/MIME/zsh-mime-setup).

`zsh-mime-setup` will setup Zsh with system default associations for file suffixes (i.e., `alias -s file-extension=system-default-handler`)

It is recommended to run this plugin first in the list to avoid overwriting any changes you may have made in other plugins.

# Useful commands

| Command string      | Value
