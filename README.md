# Zsh module for zsh-mime-setup

#### Designed for Prezto...compatible with Oh My Zsh.

Inits [zsh-mime-setup][1].

`zsh-mime-setup` will setup Zsh with system default associations for file suffixes (i.e., `alias -s file-extension=system-default-handler`)

It is recommended to run this plugin first in the list to avoid overwriting any changes you may have made in other plugins.

## Useful commands

| Command string      | Value
| ------------        | -----------
| `alias -s`          | run to list all suffix aliases
| `zsh-mime-setup -l` | handler the shell will use
